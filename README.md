# HtmlUiMockup
one page mockup exercise

Develop a simple web page that matches the following prototype 
1.	Use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript as you see appropriate, but do not make use of CSS frameworks or libraries (e.g. Bootstrap)
2.	Most importantly, ensure the look and feel is as close to the prototype as possible
3.	Make the UI responsive to different screen sizes. If possible, also make it accessible for users with visual disabilities.
4.	Provide a zip file with the HTML, CSS and any JavaScript you have developed
5.	Include a ReadMe.txt to state any assumptions that you have made for this project
